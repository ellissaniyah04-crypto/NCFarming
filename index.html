<h2> NC Farming History </h2> 
<p> North Carolina's economy has mainly depended on farm livestock and crops like tobacco since the 1800s. The state's diverse agricultural landscape has evolved significantly over the years. During the 19th century, small family farms dominated, focusing on crops like tobacco, cotton, and corn alongside livestock such as cattle, hogs, and poultry. (Grammarly,2025) </p> <br>
<p> In addition to hogs and turkeys, North Carolina has made strides in dairy farming, poultry production, and beef cattle. The state’s agricultural achievements include innovations in animal husbandry, feed efficiency, and sustainable farming practices. Many farms, like the historic "Century Farms" such as the Bynum Family Farm in Onslow County, have been in operation for over 100 years, showcasing the enduring legacy of agriculture in North Carolina.(Grammarly,2025)</p> <br>
<p>Agriculture contributes to 16% of North Carolina's economy, with livestock farming accounting for 68% of this figure. The average income for a livestock farmer in NC is $32,072 a year, though this can vary depending on the farm's size, type, and location.(Grammarly,2025)
